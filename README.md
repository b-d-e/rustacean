This repo is here to follow my progress learning the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

It contains code for examples and exercises from [the Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), split into folders corresponding to chapter numbers. Some bits might correspond to the [interactive version of the Rust Book too](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/).

I'm also working through exercises from [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), roughly corresponding to the book order.

I'm writing these in vim (all being well), partially to force myself to not rely on VS Code's autocompletion & linting, and partially to finally memorise vim & tmux's keybindings.
